            <h1>First Android App</h1>
            <img src="images/phone.jpeg" alt="Lorem Pixel image">
            <p> This is my first Android app that I created in CSE 110. It only has basic
                functionality to hide and show names, but it is a start none-the-less. This
                app will eventually develop into (hopefully) a game by the end of the quarter. 
                Currently, the red mail icon is not linked up to any action, but in the future
                I plan on redirecting it to email.
