            <h1>Number of Wildfires over the Years (Cause Separated)</h1>
            <img src="images/graph.jpeg" alt="Lorem Pixel image">
            <p> The amount of wildfires in California are increasing each 
                year and continue to destroy thousands of homes. To better prevent
                 the occurrence and spread of wildfires, many researches have been 
                 conducted by scientists to investigate the relationship between 
                 global warming and the drastically increasing amount of wildfires. 
                 However, there is still debate within the scientific community on 
                 whether global warming has a direct impact upon the rise of wildfires.
                  As the supporters claim, global warming has caused rising temperatures
                   and more droughts, and thus, prolonged Californiaâ€™s drought season by
                    at least 2 and half months longer. The National Geographic also agrees
                     that the higher air temperature causing the vegetation to be
                      significantly drier and more prone to wildfires. On the other
                       hand, opponents, including two professors at UCLA, claim that there
                        have been fewer and fewer wildfires in California since its peak
                         in 1980. Our project intends to utilize data science and data
                          visualization to investigate whether rising temperatures caused
                           by global warming increases wildfires over time. The issue of
                            wildfires in California has caught national attention and there has been
                             a large amount of data collected related to the cause and magnitude of wildfires. Furthermore,
                              many related projects have been done in the past to raise awareness on the issue. For example,
                               the WiFireLab at the San Diego SuperComputer Center created a software program, FireMap, to 
                               predict where the fire would spread since 2017 using weather data and locations of wildfires
                                happened in the past. The data and the program were used by many departments in California, 
                                and helped firefighters to inform the public about potential evacuations. In addition, data 
                                scientists have also visualized the wildfire season to provide a better visual representation
                                 of the wildfires in California throughout the year.</p>
